# SoftDev-Website
Website I created in my first year  at University, aston.

In this project I created a database, developed a website and deployed it according to industry standards.

We were told to create a placeholder website for a development company, we would have a list of companies that the client worked with, some feedback, as well as a showcase of projects, create project, edit project and delete projects. We were also told to implement a search function as well as create a login, logout and registration system. I took it on myself to implement a few security features, delving into making sure forms cant be taken advantage of. 

I added a portfolio3Report.docx about the project.
